I hope to interact with my classmates to expand my network and gain future Penn Pals!
I am excited to take a course with Boon Thau Loo as he is a well known professor in the program.
Also, I am looking forward to expanding on lessons learned in 593. I found 593 challenging but rewarding.
I am hopeful to find the same in 594.
Overall, I am hopeful to gain more in depth knowledge of how computing systems operate, and
I am excited to gain exposure to GitHub and Docker (since they are industry must haves).
